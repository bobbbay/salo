<p align="center"> A declarative, reproducible, statically-typed build/deployment toolset </p>

**Salo** is a declarative, reproducible, statically-typed configuration language for building and deploying operating system images. This leads to composable, scalable, and functional operating systems in-situ. For more information about features, read [our documentation](https://semc-labs.github.io/Salo).

## Features
 * Expressive type system (dependent, first-class functions and types)
 * Efficient deployment (leveraging diffs to only deploy what you need)
 
## Getting started

To get started with Salo, run (with Stack):

```shell
stack run -- --help
```

## Documentation

Now that you're ready with Salo, you can learn more about how to develop operating system configuration in [the documentation](https://semc-labs.github.io/Salo/).
