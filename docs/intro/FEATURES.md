# Features

Salo focuses on expressive, composable, strongly-typed solutions for configuration.

## Expressive type system

Salo's type system features first-class functions, first-class types, and dependent typing. This combination of powerful typing allows types to be as expressive as the language itself.

## Efficient deployment

Very frequently in the strongly-typed world, users sacrifice performance for composable typing. This is not the case for Salo: we use efficient, difference-based based deployment to only deploy what you need.

## On-the-fly changes

Salo's simple, expressive syntax means you can make a change in a flash. From migrating to a different base distribution, to adding a few new packages to your OS, it's all just a few lines of code away.

## Powerful history management

Salo's rollback system allows you to not only observe what configurations looked like in the past, but to go back to any given one. Quickly undo changes, or restart a project in a completely new direction: Salo has you covered.

## Staged changes

Staging changes allows you to quickly and easily visualise what a change in configuration will do to your OS. See what packages were added, which files are changed, all *before* deployment!
