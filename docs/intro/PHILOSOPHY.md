# Philosophy

The Salo project is the fruit of a community that is passionate about **composable**, **strongly-typed**, **expressive** configuration. We also believe in efficiency and reliability, which reflects in Salo's core design principles. In sum, Salo is designed to:

 * Be as composable as possible,
 * Be as efficient as possible,
 * and Be as scalable as possible.

These are the key thoughts we keep in mind during every new feature, PR, and bug fix. Our work orbits around these three values - and by using Salo, so does yours.

Wondering where to go next? How about the [installation](../getting-started). We'll walk you through installing Salo, creating a quick Salo configuration, and running it in a virtual machine. See you there!
