# Comparison to alternatives

We know that this table is written in a way to highlight Salo's strengths, and to put a spotlight on other projects' weaknesses. Hence, we strongly encourage you to try out each project yourself. In some cases, projects such as Nix and Nickel will do you much better than Salo - and that's okay! Salo is meant for a niche project set. However, if you believe that the above points are important to you, then you're at the right place already.

Without further ado, here is our comparison to alternatives:

| Name   | Strongly-typed?    | Built-in deployment? |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Salo   | ✅                 | ✅                   |
| Nix    | ❌                 | ❌                   |
| Nickel | ✅                 | ❌                   |
