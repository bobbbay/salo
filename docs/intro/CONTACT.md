# Contact us

## Chat ðŸ’¬

Our preferred method of communication is the [Discord server of our OSS organization, Nexus Aurora](https://discord.gg/uxGFjp65pK). Chat fluidity helps us to hear from you at any time, and allows multiple users to send their insights in a discussion asynchronously. Pop in, shout out that you're here about Salo (from the SEMC project), and you'll hear a response in no time.

Your project announcements, feature proposals, supports queries and sweet, sweet praise all belongs in the chat.

## Forum ðŸ“‹

Don't like chat-based discussion on Discord? You can join us on our [forum on GitHub discussions](https://github.com/semc-labs/Salo/discussions)! Asynchronous long-form discussion allows us to help with questions and support one step at a time. Anything that belongs in the chat belongs here, too - we just want to hear from you, regardless of the medium!

## GitHub issues ðŸ”©

Bug reports should be added as issues in the [Salo repository](https://github.com/semc-labs/salo).

*Any suggestion or feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you for your support!*
