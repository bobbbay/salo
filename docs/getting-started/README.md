# Getting Started

We think it's awesome that you're ready to become a Salo writer (Salo-er? Saloist?)! The following pages will get you started on installing, writing, and running Salo. Get ready to get Salo with [Stack](https://haskellstack.org), write some Salo with the editor language extensions, and run your configured OS in a VM!

Ready? You should go on to [installation](./INSTALLATION.md)!
