# Install

Salo is currently under development, and **there is no complete implementation** (as of yet). However, you can access the *work-in-progress* implementation by installing Nix and running:

```sh
$ nix shell github:semc-labs/salo
$ salo --help
```

If you don't want to install Nix, and have Idris 2 installed, you can also clone the repository and install it manually. This is **not recommended**, because you will lose the sync with dependency locks that Nix provides.
