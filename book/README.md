# Introduction

Welcome to the Salo book. The following documents outline the Salo standard, Salo's goals and aspirations, and what advantages Salo provides.

## Overview

   In short...

   * Salo is a static and dependently typed ML-inspired configuration language;
   * Salo provides a modular platform for creating and deploying OS-level configurations.

## Goals

Salo aims to:

 * Enable modular, OS-level configuration for multiple Linux distributions;
 * Use a static and dependent type system to check code at compile-time.

## Continue reading...

> Warning: there is no complete implementation of Salo as of yet, so all notes referencing a working compiler in the following notes are imaginary.

The book chapters are accessible by the bar on the left hand side. For a quick start, check out the [crash course](./crash-course/index.html).

## TODO

   These documents are very much works-in-progress! Here is a list of what's left to fill in:

   * The module system: Salo provides a modular system for enabling/disabling specific configurations
   * Type classes (traits): Grouping types by classes, enabling polymorphism
   * Type inference
   * Literate programming (org-mode): Salo enables programming side-by-side with org-mode content
   * Notation: stricter, macros alternative
