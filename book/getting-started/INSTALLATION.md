# Installation

As of yet, Salo is not production ready. In fact, most of the standard remains barely implemeneted. If you're looking to install Salo, **clone [the repository](https://github.com/semc-labs/salo)**, then run (with [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) installed):

```
stack run -- --help
```

That's all! Stack is great, because it will build everything for you under-the-hood.

If you have any issues during installation, give us [an issue](https://github.com/semc-labs/salo/issues). We'd love to look at what's going wrong, and what we can do to help.

Ready? Let's [start writing some Salo](./QUICKSTART.md)!
