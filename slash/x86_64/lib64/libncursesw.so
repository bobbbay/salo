/* GNU ld script
   Since Gentoo has critical dynamic libraries in /lib, and the static versions
   in /usr/lib, we need to have a "fake" dynamic lib in /usr/lib, otherwise we
   run into linking problems.  This "fake" dynamic lib is a linker script that
   redirects the linker to the real lib.  And yes, this works in the cross-
   compiling scenario as the sysroot-ed linker will prepend the real path.

   See bug https://bugs.gentoo.org/4411 for more info.
