  Salo is a toolset to agnostically build and deploy OS images remotely.

** Usage
   
   Salo comes in two parts: =saloc=, which is the language “compiler”, and =salo=, which generates and deploys images. Most of the time, you’ll be interacting with =salo=, but it’s good to know the underlying tools, too.

*** Installing =salo=

    With cargo:

    #+begin_src shell
    $ cargo install salo
    $ salo --help
    #+end_src

    With Nix (Flakes):
    #+begin_src shell
    $ nix shell github:semc-labs/salo
    $ salo --help
    #+end_src
